Prompt: Based on the following documents, answer the query.

Documents:
Document 1: Solve the equation: 2x+5 = 15
Document 2: Madrid is the capital of Spain.

Query: Solve the equation

Answer: I'd be happy to help! However, I need to refer only to Document 1 for this query. Based on Document 1, the equation is:

2x + 5 = 15

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

2x = 10

Then, we can divide both sides by 2, which gives us:

x = 5

So, the solution to the equation is x = 5.
