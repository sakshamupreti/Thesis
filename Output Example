Prompt: Based on the following documents, answer the query.

Documents:
Document 1: To compute the efficiency of an engine, use the formula:

Efficiency (%) = (Work Output / Heat Input) × 100

Where:
- Work Output is the useful work done by the engine.
- Heat Input is the total heat energy supplied to the engine.


Example Question:
If an engine has a Work Output of 500 Joules and a Heat Input of 2000 Joules, what is the efficiency of the engine? Show your calculations.
Document 2: Natural Frequency and Critical Speed of a Simply Supported Beam

The natural frequency of a simply supported beam is how fast it vibrates naturally, in radians per second (rad/s), called omega. For a circular cross-section, it depends on material and size. The first critical speed, in revolutions per minute (rpm), is the rotational speed where resonance occurs, based on omega.

Formulas:
1. Natural Frequency (omega in rad/s):
   omega = (pi squared / L squared) * square root of ((E * I) / (rho * A))
   Where:
   - pi = 3.14159
   - L = beam length in meters
   - E = Youngs modulus in Pascals (Pa)
   - I = moment of inertia in meters^4
   - rho = density in kg/m^3
   - A = cross-sectional area in meters^2

2. Moment of Inertia (I) for circular cross-section:
   I = (pi * d^4) / 64
   Where d = diameter in meters

3. Cross-Sectional Area (A) for circular cross-section:
   A = (pi * d^2) / 4

4. First Critical Speed (rpm):
   Critical Speed = (omega * 60) / (2 * pi)


   Guidelines to Solve for Mass Flow Rate on the Outlet of a Nozzle:

   1. Understand the Problem:
      - Identify the inlet conditions: pressure (P_in), temperature (T_in), velocity (v_in), and cross-sectional area (A_in).
      - Identify the outlet conditions: pressure (P_out), temperature (T_out), velocity (v_out), and cross-sectional area (A_out).
      - Ensure you have the fluid properties: density (rho) or specific gas constant (R) and molecular weight for gases.

   2. Use the Continuity Equation:
      - The mass flow rate (m_dot) is constant for steady flow:
        m_dot = rho_in * A_in * v_in = rho_out * A_out * v_out

   3. Calculate Density:
      - For gases, use the ideal gas law:
        rho = P / (R * T)
        Where:
        - P = pressure in Pascals (Pa)
        - R = specific gas constant in J/(kg·K)
        - T = temperature in Kelvin (K)

   4. Solve for Outlet Mass Flow Rate:
      - Calculate rho_out using outlet pressure and temperature.
      - Use the continuity equation to find m_dot:
        m_dot = rho_out * A_out * v_out

   5. Verify Units:
      - Ensure all units are consistent (e.g., SI units).
      - Convert if necessary.

   6. Additional Considerations:
      - If compressibility effects are significant, use compressible flow equations.
      - For isentropic flows, use isentropic relations to relate inlet and outlet conditions.

   Example Formula:
      m_dot = (P_out / (R * T_out)) * A_out * v_out






Query: If an engine has a Work Output of 500 Joules and a Heat Input of 2000 Joules, what is the efficiency of the engine? Show your calculations.

Answer: To answer this query, we can use Document 1: To compute the efficiency of an engine.

Efficiency (%) = (Work Output / Heat Input) × 100

Given:
- Work Output = 500 Joules
- Heat Input = 2000 Joules

Calculation:
Efficiency (%) = (500 J / 2000 J) × 100
= 25%

Therefore, the efficiency of the engine is 25%.
